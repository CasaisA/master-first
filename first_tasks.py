# Adrian. Study velo (upstream) tracks.
#  - Fraction of VELO tracks with respect to all tracks

#  - Match velo tracks to long tracks. Fraction of times you get a DeltaR< 0.25?
#  - Match velo tracks to mcparticles. Use smallest delta R.
#  - Distribution of the IDs of the mcparticles matched to VELO tracks.
#  - Momentum distribution of the mcparticles matched to VELO tracks. Same with eta and phi. Compare cases when close long tracks are present or not.
